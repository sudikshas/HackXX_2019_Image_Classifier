**Food Identification Project**

We identified that one of the problems iTradeNetworks faces while inspecting 
their food shipments is the inefficiency at labeling the foods that doesn't fit 
in a specific category.
When that happens, inspector has to manually enter the food's specification, 
which usually takes a long time, and can result in confusing data.

Therefore, we decided to take up the iTradeNetwork and came out with our 
Food Identification Project which takes in an image url under Google Cloud 
Storage and provides the most common web identification result for that image.

Our project uses Java for the main user interface and Python to integrate 
Google Cloud Vision API to obtain the identification result.

**Cloud Client Libraries for Google CLoud Storage API is needed in order to 
be able to compile the file without error.**
